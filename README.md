#Exploring-Algorithmic-Collusion-by-Q-Learning-Models
Objective 
• To determine whether algorithmic pricing models can engage in collusion and the factors influencing the its extent.
Approach
• Implemented Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using Python and numerical computation libraries.
• Developed core logic to simulate player behavior and learning in classic game scenarios like Prisoner’s Dilemma and Hawk-Dove.
• Defined key parameters G and L and used an epsilon-greedy approach for strategy exploration.
• Conducted simulations and analyzed varying cooperation probabilities to understand strategic dynamics.
Impact
• Determined the effectiveness of Q-learning in modelling player behaviour and predicting optimal strategies in complex games.
• Revealed how different reward structures and cooperation probabilities influence the emergence or breakdown of cooperation.
• Offered a deeper understanding of strategic decision-making processes in classic game theory scenarios.
