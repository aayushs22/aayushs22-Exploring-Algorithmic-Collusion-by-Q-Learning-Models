**May'24 - July'24**

**Objective**

* To determine whether algorithmic pricing models can engage in collusion and the factors influencing its extent.

**Approach**

* Implemented Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using Python and numerical computation libraries.
* Developed core logic to simulate player behavior and learning in classic game scenarios like Prisoner's Dilemma and Hawk-Dove.
* Defined key parameters and used an epsilon-greedy approach for strategy exploration.
* Conducted simulations and analyzed varying cooperation probabilities to understand strategic dynamics.

**Impact**

* Determined the effectiveness of Q-learning in modelling player behaviour and predicting optimal strategies in complex games.
* Revealed how different reward structures and cooperation probabilities influence the emergence or breakdown of cooperation.
* Offered a deeper understanding of strategic decision-making processes in classic game theory scenarios.
